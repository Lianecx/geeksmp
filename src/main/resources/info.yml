  how-it-works:
    - "Welcome to the GeekSMP! This is a place for **Twitch Subs** and **Patrons** to have fun and work together while **everyone else** can join as an undead mob!\n"
    - "As an undead mob, your job is to do as much damage as possible to make the member's lives miserable. Make sure to follow the rules though! If you manage to kill a member of the SMP, you will be **revived** and can play along as well! Be careful though, once you die you will return back into an undead mob and __your items will not be saved upon death if you are revived__.\n"
    - "What are you waiting for! Join now, or become a twitch sub to join the members in their defence against the undead mobs.\n"
